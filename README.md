# ShortestPathGame
This is a little game made to teach people to figure out the shortest path from a set of nodes.

It uses a GUI system made using the tkinter module in python version 3.4.4.

The main directory includes the source code for the game.

The __pycache__ directory is just output from py2exe, Completely useless.

The dist directory includes everything needed for the game to work, including the .exe file.

To play for yourself, download the dist folder and execute the exe in the folder.

You can move the folder anywhere on your computer, and it will work. Just be sure to move the entire folder and just not the executable.

Anyways, thanks for trying this program out, means a lot. (^.^)
